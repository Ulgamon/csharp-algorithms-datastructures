# Algorithms

Algorithms and Data Structures from the course [https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/).

Tests are written in xUnit to see if my solutions are working properly.

Coding starts with Section 4: How To Solve Coding Problems. Folder structure in project is named accordingly.

Any section that doesn't have any programming exercise will be skipped.
